# RSS Feeds

RSS is one of the most beautiful things for the free and open web. If you want to keep up with all the things I post on this website and you have a spare RSS feed reader, subscribe to these feeds:

- [Journal RSS feed](/journal/feed.xml) containing all my journal posts as found at /journal.
- [Photos RSS feed](/photos/feed.xml) containing all my photos as found at /photos.
