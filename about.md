# About

I am a designer, developer and podcaster. I live and work in the heart of Europe, Frankfurt am Main in Germany.

Currently, I'm working at [BRYTER](https://bryter.io), where I focus on leading and building our design system. Before BRYTER, I worked as a designer in different areas like logistics, bookkeeping or insurance. There I also focused on product design as well as design systems.

I co-host two different german podcasts. [Bandbreite.fm](https://bandbreite.fm) is a group podcast with friends from university (where the podcast originated). It's focused on general tech, our experiences as designer and developers as well as our daily life.

[Sprachnachrichten.fm](https://sprachnachrichten.fm) is a podcasts focused on productivity and self-improvement in the digital space. This podcast I quite young and I'm happy to do this podcast with a good friend.
