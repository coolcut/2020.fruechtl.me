I am a designer, developer and podcaster. I am currently living in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. My natural habitat is at the intersection of design, development and product management.

Right now I'm working at [BRYTER](https://bryter.io), where I focus on building and leading our design system. Before BRYTER I have been working for companies like [Clark](https://www.clark.de), [FastBill](https://www.fastbill.com) and [REICHHART](https://www.reichhart.eu/competence-centres/digital-logistics.html). Experiencing all these different industries taught be a lot about the work I do today.

In my spare time, I work on different side projects, open-source projects and co-host two podcasts.

[Bandbreite](https://bandbreite.fm) is a group podcast with friends from university (where the podcast originated). It's focused on general tech and our experiences as designers and developers.

[Sprachnachrichten](https://sprachnachrichten.fm) is a podcast focused on productivity and self-improvement in the digital space. It started in 2020 and I'm happy to be co-hosting this podcast with a good friend.
