<p>One thing I always struggled with, when it comes to static site generators, was the lack of visual editing experience. Up until now, I didn't come to terms with only writing and publishing in Markdown files.</p>
<p>This conclusion may seem weird because I love Markdown itself, and I usually choose this way of writing over any other option. The only part of this experience I hate is making all my final editing choices in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a>, <a href="https://ia.net/de/writer">IA Writer</a>, or what have you. It always felt hacky and not right to me for some reason.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in a world full of options, other solutions can bridge this gap for me. One option is a <a href="https://headlesscms.org">Headless CMS</a>, and to my surprise, there are so many different kinds of Headless CMS solutions out there. ðŸ¤¯</p>
<p>For the past couple of days, I've looked briefly at the following Headless CMS solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.contentful.com">Contentful</a></li>
<li><a href="https://strapi.io">Strapi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.storyblok.com">Storyblok</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sanity.io">Sanity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://prismic.io">Prismic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these seem quite functional and have their pros/cons. For the time being, I decided to go with Contentful. It is an established system in this area of content management, and the free plan seems manageable for me.</p>
<p>With this post, I successfully connected Contentful with my <a href="https://gridsome.org">Gridsome</a> instance. Next up: Dates and a proper RSS feed.</p>
