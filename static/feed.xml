At first, I tried to get something like an internal or predefined <code>publishDate</code> provided by Contentful. It turned out to be harder than I expected at first.</p>
<p>With a new date input in place, I was able to render a machine-optimized version of a date to my page. The next step was adding a proper <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time"><code>&lt;time&gt;</code></a> tag to every post. With a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag and the corresponding date-time attribute, I have new opportunities. I now can render both a human-readable and a machine optimized version of a date to every post.</p>
<p>After that, I rendered the machine-optimized date from Contentful inside the datetime attribute. For the human-readable side of things, Iâ€™ve added <a href="https://momentjs.com">moment.js</a> to my project. </p>
<p>With the power of <code>moment.js</code>, I&#39;ve added a <code>moment(DATE_FROM_CONTENTFUL).format(&quot;dddd, MMMM Do YYYY&quot;)</code> function call. With that in place, I can now also render an optimized date formatting for humans. The result of this specific formatting is now present in every post.</p>

Up until now, I didn&#39;t come to terms with only writing and publishing in Markdown files. </p>
<p>This conclusion may seem weird because I love Markdown itself, and I usually choose this way of writing over any other option. The only part of this experience I hate is making all my final editing choices in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a>, <a href="https://ia.net/de/writer">IA Writer</a>, or what have you. It always felt hacky and not right to me for some reason.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in a world full of options, other solutions can bridge this gap for me. One option is a <a href="https://headlesscms.org">Headless CMS</a>, and to my surprise, there are so many different kinds of Headless CMS solutions out there. ðŸ¤¯ </p>
<p>For the past couple of days, I&#39;ve looked briefly at the following Headless CMS solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.contentful.com">Contentful</a></li>
<li><a href="https://strapi.io">Strapi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.storyblok.com">Storyblok</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sanity.io">Sanity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://prismic.io">Prismic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these seem quite functional and have their pros/cons. For the time being, I decided to go with Contentful. It is an established system in this area of content management, and the free plan seems manageable for me.</p>
<p>With this post, I successfully connected Contentful with my <a href="https://gridsome.org">Gridsome</a> instance. Next up: Dates and a proper RSS feed.</p>

As Jonnie wrote in his initial post, he wants to capture his progress on this new personal website as he goes building it. I loved this idea and want to try the same thing, but maybe a bit different, we will see.</p>
<p>From where I see it now, my new website should be more focused on me, a bit more personal stuff, and a bit less &quot;professional/portfolio&quot; style. It should be more tailored towards me as a person and what I want to experiment with in the future.</p>
<p>For the first steps, I&#39;m giving <a href="https://gridsome.org">Gridsome</a> a try. Gridsome is not my final decision in terms of technology yet, but I want to see if it can help me with the goals currently occupying my head.</p>
<p>And maybe, as a positive side effect, this way of capturing my progress will finally break my struggles of keeping a blog up-to-date.</p>
