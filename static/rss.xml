As Jonnie wrote in his initial post, he wants to capture his progress on this new personal website as he goes building it. I loved this idea and want to try the same thing, but maybe a bit different, we will see.

From where I see it now, my new website should be more focused on me, a bit more personal stuff, and a bit less "professional/portfolio" style. It should be more tailored towards me as a person and what I want to experiment with in the future.

For the first steps, I'm giving [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) a try. Gridsome is not my final decision in terms of technology yet, but I want to see if it can help me with the goals currently occupying my head.

And maybe, as a positive side effect, this way of capturing my progress will finally break my struggles of keeping a blog up-to-date.]]></description><link>https://2020.fruechtl.me/post/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://2020.fruechtl.me/post/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jan FrÃ¼chtl]]></dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Content Source]]></title><description><![CDATA[One thing I always struggled with, when it comes to static site generators, was the lack of visual editing experience. Up until now, I didn't come to terms with only writing and publishing in Markdown files. 

This conclusion may seem weird because I love Markdown itself, and I usually choose this way of writing over any other option. The only part of this experience I hate is making all my final editing choices in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), [IA Writer](https://ia.net/de/writer), or what have you. It always felt hacky and not right to me for some reason.

Thankfully, in a world full of options, other solutions can bridge this gap for me. One option is a [Headless CMS](https://headlesscms.org), and to my surprise, there are so many different kinds of Headless CMS solutions out there. ðŸ¤¯ 

For the past couple of days, I've looked briefly at the following Headless CMS solutions:

- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com)
- [Strapi](https://strapi.io)
- [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io)
- [Prismic](https://prismic.io)

All of these seem quite functional and have their pros/cons. For the time being, I decided to go with Contentful. It is an established system in this area of content management, and the free plan seems manageable for me.

With this post, I successfully connected Contentful with my [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) instance. Next up: Dates and a proper RSS feed.]]></description><link>https://2020.fruechtl.me/post/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://2020.fruechtl.me/post/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jan FrÃ¼chtl]]></dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dates]]></title><description><![CDATA[With a flexible data model, provided by [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), Iâ€™ve added a new date input to my blogpost model. At first, I tried to get something like an internal or predefined `publishDate` provided by Contentful, but this was harder than I expected at first.

With a new date input in place, I was able to render a machine-optimized version of a date to my page. The next step was adding a proper [`<time>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time) tag to every post. With that `<time>` tag and the corresponding date-time attribute, I have the opportunity to render both a human-readable and a machine optimized version of a date to every post.

After that, I rendered the machine-optimized date from Contentful inside the datetime attribute. For the human-readable side of things, Iâ€™ve added [moment.js](https://momentjs.com) to my project. 

With the power of `moment.js`, I've added a `moment(DATE_FROM_CONTENTFUL).format("dddd, MMMM Do YYYY")` function call. With that in place, I can now also render an optimized date formatting for humans. The result of this specific formatting is now present on every post.]]></description><link>https://2020.fruechtl.me/post/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://2020.fruechtl.me/post/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jan FrÃ¼chtl]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
