Over the past weeks [a](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/replyin/) [lot](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/reply-links-in-rss-feeds) [of people](https://email-is-good.com/2020/07/14/rss-with-reply-via-email/) started following the [idea of Jonnie Hallman](https://destroytoday.com/blog/reply-link-in-rss-feed-posts) and added a little “Reply to …” link at the bottom of their RSS entries. This idea is so beautiful, that I needed to do the same.

From this point going forward, you can find a small little note that says…

> Reply to Jan if you want to share your thoughts about this post.

… at the bottom of my RSS entries. It uses a simple `mailto:`, that’s all.

So, what are you waiting for? Open your RSS Reader of choice, [subscribe to my RSS feed](/journal/feed.xml). If you want to share something with me about a post I’ve written, click this little “Call To Action” and write a mail. 💌
