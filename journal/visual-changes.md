This site looks different now! And to tell you a little secret, this new look also depends on the settings of your operating systems. Which mode are you currently using? Dark Mode? Light Mode? The visual changes reflect your settings. Try it yourself! ðŸŒˆ

## Part 1 â€” More structure

During the past couple of weeks, I slowly prepared this site to become more mature. I wanted to drop the "this is just a blog" feeling it communicated before â€” at least this was my feeling back then.

To tackle this problem, I first tried to build a layout system based on a grid, that allowed me to be flexible but also convey the feeling of similarity. This layout, which consists of three main parts, probably reveals itself the clearest in terms of its navigation, I changed some weeks ago.

To support my descriptions above visually, take a look at the following example page:

![](/uploads/journal/layout-grid.jpg)

When you visit some other pages on this website, you can see the three main columns in action. Sometimes two columns morph into one, but they always stay true to their initial structure.

## Part 2 â€” Color is fun

I didn't want to build another standard and simple website with a white background. I wanted to do something with color and in terms of inspiration, I definitely have to reference the websites from [Laura Kalbag](https://laurakalbag.com) and [Tatiana Mac](https://tatianamac.com) in this post. Both websites are beautiful in there own way and both use color very individually and create a unique experience throughout their website.

I wanted to do something similar, therefore I set out to create different color themes for different areas of my website. To make this extra challenging, I also set out to have them react for the dark/light mode setting of the person visiting the site.

This all may sound very challenging, and it was to some degree, but from a pure technical standpoint, CSS really makes things more approachable and straightforward. The magic-word here is [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) (aka. CSS variables). What I did was to create a small theming system like so:

```scss
body {
	--background-color: #f5f3ef;
	--text-primary-color: #{$black-90};
	--text-secondary-color: #{$black-60};
	--border-color: #{$black-10};
	--text-action-color: rgba(73, 71, 215, 0.9);
	--text-action-hover-color: rgba(73, 71, 215, 0.7);
}
```

Based on these CSS custom properties, I created a scaffold that spreads across the site and all its styles. As and example, setting the `background-color` on the `body` element with the defined `--background-color` CSS custom properties looks like this:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--background-color);
}
```

With all the setup, every page still looked the same, but it now was running on CSS custom properties instead of hardcoded values or SCSS variables.

The next step I took was adding unique classes to the individual pages I wanted to change, so I could add different styles to them.

To make this process a bit more clear, let's take the homepage as an example. The homepage only needed a new custom `background-color`, so I've added this piece of code to solve it:

```css
.cs-homepage {
  --background-color: #f1f6f9;

  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    --background-color: #12232b;
  }
}
```

All it's doing is reassigning the `--background-color` CSS custom property to `#f1f6f9`. With that, every component which is referencing this `var(--background-color)` somewhere, updates to the new color value.

To make it even more awesome and add support for dark mode, I've added the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` media query. Inside this media query I'm reassigning `--background-color` to `#12232b` - that's all. Same as usual, I'm just doing this inside the media query.

With this setup, I can react individually to every page and set all the CSS custom properties I've listed earlier to any value I want. 

It's a simple but powerful approach to add custom theming to my site. For more details, feel free to look into the [repository of this site](https://github.com/coolcut/fruechtl.me).
