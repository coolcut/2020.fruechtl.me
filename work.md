My career as a designer and developer started 2011 with my first WordPress blog about my favorite football club, Eintracht Frankfurt. This blog was a gateway to a new world for me. Sooner than later, it led me to building websites for companies as a freelancer starting 2014.

After a brief interlude of studying Interactive Media Design I stopped university altogether.

Instead, I started working at REICHHART in 2015. This role is a precedent for my love of being a generalist and moving between the world of design and development.

In 2018, I joined FastBill to help improve and scale their design effort and bring the product to a more user-friendly world. During my time there I learned so much more about product designs in general.

In 2019 and after I short stint at Clark, I joined BRYTER. At BRYTER I'm not only working as a product designer, but also building and maintaining our design system.

Here I have the opportunity to not only contribute immensly in shaping the product but also the way we work and think about design in general. Iâ€™m very fortunate to collaborate and learn from incredible and real passionate people.
