Social networks or other sites that are similar in their shape and form come and go. I really want to focus on publishing a lot of things that are important to me here, on my own website.

I also have account elsewhere and if you want to interact with my there, please do. I'm always happy to interact with interesting humans. Here is a list of curated sites, where you can connect with me:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_coolcut)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/coolcut)
- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/coolcut)
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@coolcut)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/_coolcut)

Besides all that, I want to encourage you to subscribe to the [RSS Feed](/journal/feed.xml) of my journal. Last but not least, if you'd like to talk to me about a specific subject or nearly anything, feel free to [email me](mailto:jan@fruechtl.me).
