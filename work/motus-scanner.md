      <p>Motus is an industry and logistics software platform with a focus on fast, safe and more transparent logistic processes. In another case study, I&#39;ve already talked about the development of the web interface for managing warehouse processes with motus warehouse - but there is more to this story.</p>
      <p>Motus warehouse exists of two parts: The web application for managing processes and the mobile application for scanning, verifying, and moving handling units through a warehouse. With that in mind, the Android app is the key to a fast, safe, and reliable logistic process.</p>
      <p>In close collaboration with our customers, we developed a robust application that guided a professional warehouse worker througn their warehouse and day.</p>

        <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Challenge</h2>
        <p>The Android application is the daily driver for every worker inside a warehouse. A worker can see their upcoming orders, execute a particular order, and scan handling units, etc. The application guides the logistician through a workday and tries to minimize potential errors while also verifying every step.</p>
        <p>In a stressful and time-focused industry, human errors are inescapable. We had to build an application that would minimize any chance of making mistakes during a process. This application had to become not only a helpful waymarker but also a supporting companion.</p>
        <p>As a consequence of the logistics industry and their particular requirements, we couldn&#39;t choose any standard smartphone as a target device. We needed a specific and industry robust device running a very outdated version of Android.</p>

        <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Approach</h2>
        <p>We built many different prototypes to test our various strategies and ideas. In close communication with stakeholders and experts in the logistics area, we reviewed our thoughts and findings very closely.</p>
        <p>On the visual side of things, we wanted to stay as close to the Android platform as possible. We studied the Material Design Specs and tried to be as close to these specs as possible. This would not only help us in our visual design work, but also would speed up development efforts.</p>

      <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Implementation</h2>
      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>My primary responsibilities were the conceptual and visual design as well as in-depth prototyping of user flows and some specific interactions.</p>
        <p>The main idea behind the Android application is the segmentation of specific processes. Every process, like &quot;Goods Receiving&quot; or &quot;Goods Outwards,&quot; is its own entity and acts completely independently. Furthermore, each process has its own visual theme, which helps the worker in different situations. Workers know that process &quot;X&quot; always has the blue theme.</p>

      <p>Besides visual clues, the application supports different kinds of feedback through audio and vibration techniques. With these various cognitive elements, we tried to make the Android app into a companion that helps the worker with very subtle but distinct notifications.</p>
      <p>Another big idea behind this application is the so-called &quot;Cargo List.&quot; A cargo list is more or less an abstraction of a shopping basket and displays any scanned handing unit and the corresponding information and destination. In this setting, a worker can select any order or handling unit inside a cargo list for further transfer.</p>

      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>Every idea and concept has to be tested and validated before handing it over to the developers. I was deeply invested in different ways of prototyping ideas or mimicking user flows for further explanation or discussions. Our primary tools while prototyping were Marvel and Framer. </p>
        <p>The overall user flows and click-dummies were made with Marvel, because of the faster setup process. When it came to specific interactions or animations, I switched to Framer. Framer gave us vast opportunities and flexibility in making interactions or animations.</p>

      <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">What Iâ€™ve Learned</h2>
      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>One hard challenge while designing the motus warehouse Android app was the decision-making process for some UI components. As I mentioned earlier, we didn&#39;t want to reinvent the wheel on every single pixel, because Google has great resources like Material Design for building Android apps. Sadly, in some situations, the Material Design components didn&#39;t fit as well as we were hoping for, and we had to make some components ourself to solve the different issues in a meaningful manner.</p>
        <p>One takeaway from this experience was definitely that it&#39;s okay to break these boundaries when it benefits the customers. Breaking boundaries don&#39;t mean moving in the complete opposite direction. It only means taking the problem you are trying to solve into account and finding a suitable solution.</p>
        <p>Another lesson I got from this project is early feedback with on-device prototyping. In nearly every situation, initial feedback is an excellent way to start, but when it comes to personal devices like smartphones, on-device testing is a real game changer. Testing different lighting situations, sounds, and more only works on the device and in action. Stakeholders and customers can see ideas and design on my fancy iMac, but the real usage and feeling only comes when they are using it on a real device. A prototype should feel like the real thing because only then seeking feedback can be really insightful.</p>
