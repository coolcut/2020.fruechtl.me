      <p>Motus itself is an industry and logistics software platform with a focus on fast, safe and more transparent logistic processes. At the beginning of 2016, we started thinking about one essential addition to the overall motus product family, motus warehouse.</p>
      <p>The web application part of motus warehouse is primarily focused on managing different kinds of master records while maintaining the entire logistics process itself. To meet the needs of our customers, we needed to come up with a solution that can work on as many devices and systems as possible, while being user-friendly and accessible in different situations.</p>
      <p>One key factor that contributed to the success of this initial iteration of the motus warehouse product was our component-based approach during the design and development of our user interface. This approach allowed us to move quickly while also building an in-depth documentation and internal design system that grew slowly but steadily.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we gathered a lot of positive feedback and success stories during our testing rounds on the ground in actual warehouses. This open and continuous feedback loop was a crucial part during our development phase.</p>

        <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Challenge</h2>
        <p>To successfully solve the needs of companies who operate in the logistics market, which mostly offers slow, conservative and principally offers isolated software solutions, motus needed to be on the opposite side. The questions for us was “How can we build a solution that consists of a generic base with modular, extendable plugins while always keeping a user-focused approach?”.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, our customers generally were under immense stress and have to work quickly to meet the high rates of a successful logistics company. Tasks, like editing master records, overlooking statistics, and composing reports, have to be done as effective as possible, and we needed to optimise for these specific use-cases.</p>

    <div class="">
      <div class="cs-section-content">
        <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Approach</h2>
        <p>To handle all these different challenges successfully, we built different prototypes first and kept a close communication line to our customers to get their feedback early on. These prototypes were mostly static web applications that incorporated different ideas about fast and error-prone master record management.</p>
        <p>Early on, we also thought about introducing a component-based development approach. At first, we wanted to free up resources and speed up our overall development process, but at second thought, we also saw the benefit in documenting user-interfaces.</p>

      <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Implementation</h2>
      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>In our product development team, I was mainly responsible for the design process as well as the implementation of these designs as a frontend developer. During this time, we were heavily relying on Patternlab to support our component-based design approach on the frontend side.</p>
        <p>The primary focus while developing the motus warehouse web application has been master data creation and content management — this web application is the central hub for all logistics management overviews. Because of this focus, we tested many approaches for desktop computers as well as mobile devices with our customers. The provided feedback during these tests was precious during different decision-making processes and helped us mainly.</p>

      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>Visually, motus warehouse firmly integrates the metaphor of card-based design. Every component is made from a card and is structured unambiguously. Nearly everything is subtle — bright colours are rare.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we decided early on that icons can make a difference in communicating with our users. Icons alone can&#39;t provide enough value on their own, but with colours and labels, they can markedly enhance the overall experience and make different actions and components easier to understand. Therefore, we decided to build our icon library to have full control over the icon set and our style.</p>

      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>As mentioned before, we wanted to improve our development output and overall documentation of how we build motus as a product. This thinking brought us to the idea of our internal design system. I led the development of our design system and contributed closely together with our product and development team.</p>
        <p>As a company, we thought was beyond just components and more about values, principles and feedback methods that all would be part of this system. The broad and overall thinking about processes, feedback and overall alignment towards the company goals was very beneficial to us during this time.</p>

      <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">What I’ve Learned</h2>
      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>Today, motus is a small logistics solution that is going to grow over the following months and years. The main takeaways for me during my time there were the following:</p>
        <h4>Component-based design 👍</h4>
        <p>A component-based approach while designing and developing user interfaces is the right way to go. It benefits both sides, design, and development, and is also a crucial part when it comes to design systems.</p>
        <h4>Own assumptions 🕵️‍♂️</h4>
        <p>Question your assumptions with real customers as early and often as you can. Your initial assumptions will mostly be wrong. Listen to users, their problems and observe their day-to-day work and find solutions that benefit them.</p>
        <h4>Perfection in an early stage 👂+ 🚢+👂</h4>
        <p>Don&#39;t be overly precious and detail-oriented when it comes to shipping in the early stages of your product. Listen, develop, ship and listen again.</p>
        <h4>Design systems 🥰</h4>
        <p>It doesn&#39;t matter how big your company is, a design system has the potential to benefit every company. A design system is also much more than just a component library, just more a toolbox with different aspects of working together in a faster and more structured way. But don&#39;t overthink it too much, when you are small — it can be a rabbit hole if you are not careful and intentional in the construction of such a system.</p>
