      <p>CouchTimes is the result of my constant frustration with TV show tracking applications on the market and my desire of building my very own native iOS applications. With this in mind, I set out to build a simple version of what I would like to see in a TV show tracking application.</p>
      <p>The application is focused on some key tasks, like searching for new shows, seeing recommendations, getting detailed information on a specific show and marking individual episodes as watched.</p>
      <p>CouchTimes hasn’t reached 1.0 yet, but you can <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/TvEyoBQx">download it from TestFlight</a> and play with it, if you are interested.</p>
      <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Focus on the simple first step</h2>
      <p>The beauty of side projects often lies in the fact that you can do whatever you want, but are most of the time limited in terms of time, resources and technical abilities if you, like I am, design and develop the application on your own.</p>
      <p>Especially the development part can sometimes hinder the process of getting something quick out the door. For me Swift and especially SwiftUI is new territory and sometimes tasks that look small can blow up. That’s why I’m very caution about the scope of the first version of CouchTimes and also don’t want to make the most feature-rich application out there.</p>
      <p>With more time and thought I appreciate more and more the simple, focus and easy solutions. The solutions where you might think “It would be awesome if X or Y would be supported”, but you barely think about the features that are existing in a negative way. </p>
      <p>It became clear to me that this way of thinking might be a path to more sustainable software and projects and general.</p>

        <p>Wearing multiple hats during a project&#39;s lifecycle is the way naturally shift towards. While I from time to time played with iOS development in the past, I never published or build a fully functional and comparable application too CouchTimes.</p>
        <p>It really was a rollercoaster ride so far for me, with huge and detailed learnings about iOS development, Swift, SwiftUI Core Data and Networking. Especially SwiftUI got me thinking about new way of adoption some pattern to the work I do for the Bliss Design System.</p>
