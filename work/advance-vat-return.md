      <p>In Germany, the official advance VAT return document from the German fiscal authority is rather complex and FastBill didn&#39;t support any advance VAT return (Umsatzsteuer-Voranmeldung) functionality. After speaking to customers and evaluating different options, we knew the majority of use cases of this feature were on the simpler side of things.</p>
      <p>Our customers weren’t looking for a solution to solve every stress-case, they were looking for a solution to their basic needs. More complex uses cases often were handled by tax accountant anyway.</p>
      <p>In a short amount of time, we conceptualised and developed this feature. Every step in this process was filled with different feedback loops as well as internal and external user-testing rounds for gathering real-life feedback from our customers.</p>

        <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Challenge</h2>
        <p>The main challenge during this process was to slice the chunk from the huge and complicated topic that is advance VAT return. Because this topic can be varied based on the specific setup of a company, we needed to make sure to solve a problem for the majority of our customers.</p>
        <p>Besides that, communication with official fiscal authorities can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming and threatening. Therefore, we not only make the process simple and fast, but also build trust in this feature and the action the individual customer takes in handing in their advance VAT return document.</p>

      <div class="cs-section-content">
        <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Approach</h2>
        <p>Early in the process, we set out some hypothesis we needed to validate before moving into a more detail-oriented design phase. One of these hypothesis was the question &quot;How many fields of the official German advance VAT return document do we need to implement to satisfy the majority of our users?&quot;.</p>
        <p>Another big questions during our process was the questions “How might we make the advance VAT return process feel uncomplicated and comprehensible”? This point specifically is all about trust and understanding of the actions that the customers are taking, while they probably aren’t an expert in tax specific topics.</p>

      <h2 class="title-2 f-mb3">Implementation</h2>
      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>After some initial discussions and interviews with customers, it became obvious to us that scoping the project down to the lowest common denominator (which were a handful of advance VAT return fields) would still help the majority of our customers.</p>
        <p>Additionally, one of the keys to the success of this project was the idea of a multi-step form flow. That way we could split up the complexity, which comes with the topic, into smaller and manageable junks of information, while still having enough room for explanations and transparency.</p>
        <p>With these ideas in mind, we tested small prototypes with customers. After seeing the evident success of these prototypes, we quickly moved into a more detail-oriented phase of visual design.</p>

      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>In the beginning, I mentioned the idea of a transparent process throughout the wizard. We solved a considerable chunk of this challenge with the last step of our form wizard — the result screen. The purpose of this screen is mainly to show the user every entered input. Furthermore, they can also see a preview of the estimated amount of money they owe or get back from the fiscal authority.</p>
        <p>Our goal here was to lower the anxiety levels of our customers. Every customer would get a clear picture of the specific data that will be transmitted. As a result of that, potential mistakes would become visible before it is too late.</p>
        <p>During our usability tests, this screen performed exceptionally well, and customers felt more empowered and informed about their transmission.</p>

        <p>We also implemented a way for our customers to take a valid test run. This test run was a fully functional implementation and calls the official fiscal authority APIs, but it was never a &quot;real submission&quot;. In our analysis and since the official launch, this feature was often used and also extremely positive in helping explore this feature for interested users.</p>

      <div class="cs-section cs-section--screens">
        <p>The advance VAT return feature was one of the best and smoothest features we did at FastBill. During this process, I learned a lot about early hypothesis validation, the scope of MVPs and thoroughly thinking about the mindset of our users.</p>
        <p>In some phases, during this project, I struggled with keeping the constraints for the project. Sometimes it is hard to cut beloved features or improvements because they are not going to make it for the upcoming release. But as long as everything moves in small and steady improvement cycles, it will pay off eventually.</p>
